OSU Bootcamp: Module 1 Assignment


## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Google DeepMind

* When was the company incorporated?
September 23, 2010

* Who are the founders of the company?
Demis Hassabis, Shane Legg, Mustafa Suleyman

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
As described on their About page, 
>> The research lab brought together new ideas and advances in machine learning, neuroscience, engineering, mathematics, simulation and computing infrastructure, along with new ways of organizing scientific endeavors [1].

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
DeepMind was purchased by Google in 2014 for approximately $500M [2], and in 2023 merged with Google Brain, Google's own research lab which started in 2011 [1]. In the time since they have been funded by Google with an unknown budget.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
One primary focus has been on game-playing agents, including AlphaGo playing Go and AlphaZero playing chess. After the merger with Google Brain, they have refocused on large language models and AI image and video models to help them compete with OpenAI's ChatGPT after its rise to worldwide notoriety. [3]

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customer is any Google user, especially those using the Gemini assistant. They also have several products with specific applications, such as AlphaFold which can model protein structures and the AlphaZero and MuZero game-playing systems, which are freely available or demonstration pieces for their innovative technologies.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
They are part of Google, and have access to their untold resources, but they also have a history of true innovation that changes the industry at large, including DeepMind demonstrating the power of deep learning on a global scale with AlphaGo's match against Lee Sedol in 2015, and Google Brain inventing the Transformer architecture that we will cover later in the course. [1]

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing&mdash;you may want to search the companyâ€™s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Their focus is on deep learning neural networks and cutting-edge AI systems, including text model Gemini, video model Veo, and image model Imagen 3. They also just released details on a digital watermarking system that allows for AI-generated images to be idenitfied. Their technologies are the underpinning concepts for much of the large language model development community [1].

## Landscape

* What field is the company in?
The focus is on machine learning research, specifically deep learning neural networks and their many applications. [1]

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this field over the last 5&ndash;10 years?
Large language models have taken over the public's imagination, but there has been significant progress on chess bots and game-playing agents spearheaded by DeepMind's projects with Go, Starcraft 2, chess, and the Atari 2600 catalog to name a few.

* What are the other major companies in this field?
Other major companies in this field include Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft.

## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
Some of the most impactful innovations of the past decade have come from DeepMind and Google Brain, namely the Transformer architecture that underpins modern large language models.

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?
That question is especially difficult to answer in this context, because the industry is in its infancy and companies are not especially communicative about trade secrets. But by all accounts, Google DeepMind is at the forefront of artificial intelligence research and development. There has been some discussion about Google's chatbot Bard struggling when compared to ChatGPT [3], but Google DeepMind has released several updates and new models since that time.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?
They just released several updates to their products at Google I/O, including an unedited minute of AI-generated video from a text prompt. It seems like their performance and innovation is continuing to set the industry standard.

## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)
I would like to see them continue to develop Gemini combined with their search engine to attempt to verify the veracity of the model's statements.

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?
If they could achieve such a feat, we would be well on our way to a true general artificial intelligence and a true sea change in how we interact with digital agents.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?
It would leverage much of what they have built over the past decade or more and continue their innovative push for new technology inventions.

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?
These would be appropriate as an expansion of their current offerings and development trajectory.
